## Question 1

You are interested in estimating $\beta$ in the following regression:

$$y_i=\alpha+\beta x_i+\epsilon_i,$$

where $\mathbb{E}[x_iu_i]\neq0$. Since you observe a binary instrumental variable $(z_i \in \{0, 1\}$ for any $i \in \{1, \ldots, N\})$ that is relevant $(\mathbb{E}[z_ix_i]\neq 0)$ and valid $(\mathbb{E}[z_iu_i] = 0)$, you can consistently estimate $\beta$ using the IV estimator,

$$\hat{\beta}_{IV} = \frac{[\sum^n_{i=1}(z_i - \bar{z})(y_i - \bar{y})]}{[\sum_{i=1}^n(z_i - \bar{z})(x_i - \bar{x})]},$$

the 2SLS estimator,

$$\hat{\beta}_{2SLS} = \frac{[\sum_{i=1}^{n}(z_i - \bar{z})(x_1 - \bar{x})][\sum_{i=1}^n(z_i - \bar{z})]^{-1}[\sum^n_{i=1}(z_i - \bar{z})(y_i - \bar{y})]}{[\sum_{i=1}^{n}(z_i - \bar{z})(x_1 - \bar{x})][\sum_{i=1}^n(z_i - \bar{z})]^{-1}[\sum_{i=1}^n(z_i - \bar{z})(x_i - \bar{x})]},$$

or the Wald estimator,

$$\hat{\beta}_{W} = \frac{\frac{1}{N_1}\sum_{i|z_i = 1} y_i - \frac{1}{N_0}\sum_{i|z_i = 0} y_i }{\frac{1}{N_1}\sum_{i|z_i = 1} x_i - \frac{1}{N_0}\sum_{i|z_i = 0} x_i},$$

where $\bar{y_1}=\frac{\sum_{i|z_i=1}y_i}{N_1}, \bar{y_0}=\frac{\sum_{i|z_i=0}y_i}{N_0}, \bar{x_1}=\frac{\sum_{i|z_i=1}x_i}{N_1}, \bar{x_0}=\frac{\sum_{i|z_i=0}x_i}{N_0}, N_1$ is the number of units whose instrumental variable assumes the value of 1 and $N_0$ is the number of units whose instrumental variable assumes the value of 0.

Show that those three estimators are numerically equal.

$\hat{\beta_{2SLS}}$ is clearly equal to $\hat{\beta_{IV}}$ since terms cancel out. Let's show that $\hat{\beta_{IV}}$ is identical to Wald. Take only the numerator of $\hat{\beta_{IV}}$ and expand it:

\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{N}(z_i-\bar{z})(y_i-\bar{y})&=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z_iy_i-z_i\bar{y}-\bar{z}y_i+\bar{z}\bar{y})\\
    &=\sum_{i=1}^{N}z_iy_i -N\bar{z}\bar{y}\\
    &=\sum_{i|z_i=1}^{N_1}y_i-N\bar{z}\bar{y}
\end{align*}

Let $p = N_1 / N$, $1-p = N_0 / N$ and notice that $N_1(1-p) = N_0p = K$. Also, $\bar{z}=p$ and we can write:

$$\bar{y}=\frac{1}{N}(\sum_{i|z_i=0}^{N_0}y_i + \sum_{i|z_i=1}^{N_1}y_i)$$ 

then:

\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{N}(z_i-\bar{z})(y_i-\bar{y})&=N_1\bar{y_1}-p(N_0\bar{y_0}+N_1\bar{y_1})\\
    &=K(\bar{y_1}-\bar{y_0})
\end{align*}

Take the same steps for the denominator and reach the result $K(\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_0})$ and thus:

\begin{align*}
    \hat{\beta_{IV}}=\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}(z_i - \bar{z})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n(z_i - \bar{z})(x_i - \bar{x})}&=\frac{K(\bar{y_1}-\bar{y_0})}{K(\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_0})}\\
    &=\frac{(\bar{y_1}-\bar{y_0})}{(\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_0})} = \hat{\beta_{W}}
\end{align*}

## Question 2

**You are interested in estimating $\beta$ in the following regression:**

$$y_i=\alpha+\beta x_i+u_i,$$


**Where $\mathbb{E}[x_iu_i]\neq 0$. You also observe a random variable $z_i$ such that it is relevant, $\mathbb{E}[z_ix_i]\neq 0$, but not valid as an instrument, $\mathbb{E}[z_iu_i]\neq 0$. You decide to estimate:**

$$\hat{\beta}_{OLS}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}}{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\bar{x})^2}, $$

**and**

$$\hat{\beta}_{IV}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{(z_i-\bar{z})(y_i-\bar{y})}}{\sum_{i=1}^N{(z_i-\bar{z})(x_i-\bar{x})}}. $$

**We want to derive conditions under which the OLS estimator may be a better option than the IV estimator.**

**(a) Show that the asymptotic bias of the OLS estimator is given by**

$$plim(\hat{\beta}_{OLS})-\beta=corr(x_i,u_i)\times\frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_x}$$

First of all we can work with demeaned equation such that we can redefine $x_i:=x_i-\bar{x}$, $y_i:=y_i-\bar{y}$ and $z_i:=z_i-\bar{z}$. Thus our OLS estimator is given by:


\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta}_{OLS}&=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{x_iy_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i^2}\\
&=\beta +\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{x_iu_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i^2}
\end{align*}


and knowing that $corr(x_i, u_i)=cov(x_i,u_i)\sigma_x\sigma_u$, we have the following asymptotic result:


\begin{align*}
plim(\hat{\beta}_{OLS})-\beta&=\frac{cov(x,u)}{\sigma_x^2}\\
&=corr(x,u)\times\frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_x}
\end{align*}


**(b) Show that the asymptotic bias of the IV estimator is given by**

$$plim(\hat{\beta}_{OLS})-\beta=\frac{corr(z_i,u_i)}{corr(z_i,x_i)}\times\frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_x}$$

Our $\hat{\beta_{IV}}$ will be given by:

\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta}_{IV}&=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^Nz_iy_i}{\sum_{i=1}^Nz_ix_i}\\
&=\beta+ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^Nz_iu_i}{\sum_{i=1}^Nz_ix_i}
\end{align*}


and asymptotically we have that:


\begin{align*}
plim(\hat{\beta}_{IV})-\beta&=\frac{cov(z,u)}{cov(z,x)}\\
&=\frac{corr(z,u)\sigma_z\sigma_u}{corr(z,x)\sigma_z\sigma_x}\\
&=\frac{corr(z,u)}{corr(z,x)}\times\frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_x}
\end{align*}

**(c) When is the OLS estimator preferred to the IV estimator in terms of bias? Is this condition easier to hold when the instrument is weak, i.e., when there is a small correlation between the instrumental variable and the endogenous variable?**

OLS would be preferred to IV if $|corr(x,u)|<|\frac{corr(z,u)}{corr(z,x)}|$. If the instrument is weak, $corr(z,x)\rightarrow 0$ making it unlikely that IV would result in lower bias. In this case one should be sure the instrument is valid, that is, $corr(z,u)=0$. Otherwise OLS might be a better (less bad) choice.

## Question 3

**Consider a simple time series model under the assumption that the assumption that the independent variable presents classical measurement error:**

$$y_t=\alpha+\beta x_t^*+u_t$$

$$x_t=x_t^*+e_t$$

**where $u_t$ is serially non-correlated, has zero mean and it is non-correlated with $x_t^*$ and $e_t$. We only observe $y_t$ and $x_t$. Assume that $e_t$ is serially non-correlated, has zero mean and it is non-correlated with $x_t^*$. In order to simplify the algebra, assume that $x_t^*$ has zero mean.**

**(a) Write $x_t^*=x_t-e_t$ and plug it in your main equation. Show that the error term in the new equation, $v_t$, is negatively correlated with $x_t$ if $\beta >0$. Under those assumption, is the OLS estimator of $\beta$ consistent?**


\begin{align*}
y_t&=\alpha+\beta (x_t-e_t)+u_t\\
&=\alpha+\beta x_t+\underbrace{u_t-\beta e_t}_{v_t}\\
\end{align*}


Now we can compute $\mathbb{E}[x_t v_t]$, but first notice that $\mathbb{E}[x_te_t]=\sigma_e^2$, and then:


\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[x_tv_t]&=cov(x_t, v_t), \quad \text{since both have zero mean}\\
&=cov(x_t,u_t-\beta e_t)\\
&=\cancelto{0}{cov(x_t, u_t)}-\beta cov(x_t, e_t)\\
&=-\beta\sigma_e^2
\end{align*}

Since $\sigma_e^2 > 0$, then the correlation of $x_t$ to $v_t$ is negative if $\beta$ is positive. OLS is not consistent in this case because the regressor is correlated to the error term and the resulting asymptotic bias is $plim(\hat{\beta_{ols}}-\beta)=\frac{-\beta\sigma_e^2}{\sigma_x^2}$.

**(b) Assume also that $u_t$ and $e_t$ are non-correlated with all the past values of $x_t^*$ and $e_t$. Show that $\mathbb{E}[x_{t-1}v_t]=0$.**

We have that $x_{t-1}=x_{t-1}^*+e_{t-1}$ and thus $\mathbb{E}[x_{t-1}v_t] = \mathbb{E}[x_{t-1}^*-\beta e_tx_{t-1}^*+e_{t-1}u_t-\beta e_{t-1}e_t]=0$, since all expectations are assumed to be zero.

**(c) Is it reasonable to believe that $x_t$ and $x_{t-1}$ are correlated? Explain with examples.**

The correlation of $x_t$ and $x_{t-1}$ comes from the correlation of $x_t^*$ and $x_{t-1}^*$, thus if we have a strong belief this is the case, then it is reasonable to think $x_t$ and $x_{t-1}$ are correlated. This is the case of any time series that presents autocorrelation in its data generating process. While this is not very common in prices of financial assets, this autocorrelation is easily found in macroeconomic series like GDP, inflation, interest rates, unemployment, etc. 

**(d) How can you consistently estimate $\beta$ according to the discussion in the previous items?**

As long as $x_t$ and $x_{t-1}$ are correlated and we have that $x_{t-1}$ is not correlated to the error term, $v_t$, then $x_{t-1}$ may be used as an instrument to $x_{t}$. The IV estimator will be consistent for $\beta$.

## Question 4

**We are interested in the regression of log wages, $y_i$, on the years of schooling, $s_i$, while controlling for ability, $a_i$. We can write this:**

$$y_i = \alpha + \rho s_i + \gamma a_i + \epsilon_i$$

**where the population regression coefficients $\alpha , \rho , \gamma$ are defined such as $\epsilon_i$ is uncorrelated with $s_i$ and $a_i$.**

**(a) Suppose you estimate a bivariate regression of $y_i$ on $s_i$ instead. Derive the bivariate OLS coefficient. This coefficient converges in probability to what? When does the short-regression gives you the coefficient $\rho$ from the long regression?**

This is a case where we are running OLS with a omitted variable and hence there is gonna exist a bias in our estimate. Our OLS estimator in this case can be written as:


\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho}_{short}=\rho+\gamma\frac{\sum s_ia_i}{\sum s_i^2}+\frac{\sum s_i\epsilon_i}{\sum s_i^2}\\
plim(\hat{\rho}_{short})=\rho+\gamma\frac{cov(s,a)}{var(s)}
\end{align*}

Knowing that $\hat{\rho_{long}}\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}\rho$, then $\hat{\rho}_{short}$ will be equal to the true parameter if either $\gamma = 0$ or $cov(s,a)=0$, but since we are dealing with sample estimations, the sample counterparts, $\hat{\gamma}$ or $\widehat{cov}(s,a)$ must be zero.

**(b) Why is the long regression more likely to have a causal interpretation? Or is it?**

The long regression is more likely to have a causal interpretation because **after** controlling for ability, it's more likely that years of schooling is randomly assigned and thus elimating selection bias within each group defined by ability. But we need to be aware that, for this to be true, we have to control for *every* variable that may have a relation to wage, otherwise, without an explicity randomization on the regressor, we cannot guarantee a causal interpretation.

**In general, we are not able to control for ability... In a 1991 article, Joshua Angrist and Alan Krueger used childrenâs season of birth as an instrumental variable for years of completed schooling to solve this problem. Their idea is as follows: U.S. children born in the fall of the calendar year typically enter school (first grade) shortly after they turn six - that is, in September of their sixth year of life. Children born the following winter, however (just a few months later), must delay the start of school for a full calendar relative to those born the prior fall. The reason: those born in winter are roughly 5 years and 9 months old in the September of their sixth calendar year - which is too young to enter first grade. These children therefore typically enter the first grade when they are approximately six years and nine months of age. Since U.S. law prevents children from dropping out of school before age 16, children born in the winter are required to complete fewer years of schooling than children born in the fall. Putting these pieces together, comparing winter versus fall births can potentially serve as an instrumental variable for analyzing the causal effect of schooling on earnings. Sounds crazy, right? But see the two figures below from their paper.**


**(c) Call $Z$ the instrumental variable, where $Z = 1$ means that a child was born in the winter and $Z = 0$ means that a child was born in the fall.**

**(c.1) What are the two conditions necessary for Z to be a valid instrumental variable for assessing the causal effect of years of schooling on earnings?**

i) _instrument relevance_: $corr(z, x)\neq 0$. The instrument must be correlated to years of schooling. This seems a plausible assumption and can be tested. Figure I is making this case.

ii) _exclusion restriction_: $corr(z,e)=0$. The instrument must not be correlated to the error term, in other words, $Z$ cannot be correlated to any unobserved variables, including ability. This is not testable and we must rely on good reasoning. Since date of birth is not likely to have any influence on ability, it is a plausible assumption.

**(c.2) Which of these conditions is testable, and how would you test it?**

Only the relevance is testable. Compute the sample covariance and test it against an alternative hypothesis this covariance is not equal to zero.

**(d) You have compiled the following data:**

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|llll}
       & Winter birth (Z=1) & Fall birth (Z=0) &  &  \\
       \hline
E(s|Z) & 12.4         & 12.6       &  &  \\
E(w|z) & \$41,300     & \$42,100   &  &  
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

**(d.1) What is your estimate of the causal effect of being born in Winter versus Fall on average years of completed schooling? Using the IV terminology, how do you call that?**

$\bar{s}_1-\bar{s}_0=\mathbb{E}[s|Z=1]-\mathbb{E}[s|Z=0]=-0.2$

This is first stage estimate, $\hat{\delta}$ of $s_i=\delta_0+\delta Z_i+u_i$.

**(d.2) What is your estimate of the causal effect of being born in Winter versus Fall on average earnings? Using the IV terminology, how do you call that?**

$\bar{w}_1-\bar{w}_0=\mathbb{E}[w|Z=1]-\mathbb{E}[w|Z=0]=-800$

This is the reduced form estimate, $\hat{\pi}$ of $w_i=\pi_0+\pi Z_i+v_i$

**(d.3) Show that for a binary instrument, your instrumental variable estimator is the same as the ratio of two comparisons of means. What is your IV estimate of the causal effect of one year of education on earnings in this case?**

$$\hat{\beta}_{IV}=\frac{\bar{w}_1-\bar{w}_0}{\bar{s}_1-\bar{s}_0}=4000$$

We have shown that $\hat{\beta}_{IV}=\hat{\beta}_{Wald}$ when the instrument is a binary variable in question 1.

## Question 5

**During the 1880s, a cartel known as the Joint Executive Committee (JEC) controlled the rail transport of grain from the Midwest to eastern cities in the United States. The cartel preceded the Sherman Antritrust Act of 1890, and it legally operated to increase the price of grain transportation above what would have been the competitive price. From time to time, cheating by members of the cartel brought about a temporary collapse of the collusive price-setting agreement. In this exercise, you will use variations in supply associated with the cartelâs collapses to estimate the elasticity of demand for rail transport of grain. We will use a data file JEC.dta that contains weekly observations on the rail shipping price and other factors from 1880 to 1886. So, our main goal is to estimate the elasticity of demand for rail shipping of grain. In particular, we wish to regress $\ln(Q_i)$ where $Q_i$ is the total tonnage of grain shipped in week $i$, on $\ln(P_i)$, where $P_i$ is the price of shipping a ton of grain by rail.**

**(a) Estimate the price elasticity of demand by using OLS to regress the log of the quantity of grain shipped on the log of the price and the full set of monthly binary indicators. What is the estimated value of the demand elasticity and its standard error?**

Loading Dataset

```{r load, cache=TRUE}
JEC <- read_dta("JEC.dta")
data_red <- data.frame(ln_price = log(JEC$price), 
                       ln_quantity = log(JEC$quantity), 
                       JEC[,5:16])
```

The OLS regression model is:

\begin{equation}
\ln(Q_i)= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(P_i)+\sum_{j=1}^{12}\gamma_j seasj_i + \varepsilon_i\\
(\#eq:ols-reg)
\end{equation}

```{r ols-reg, results = "asis"}
reg_ols <-  lm(ln_quantity ~ . , data = data_red)
se_ols <- sqrt(diag(vcovHC(reg_ols, type = "HC1")))

stargazer(reg_ols, type = "latex", header = FALSE,
          label = "tab:q5table1",
          title = "OLS estimation.",
          dep.var.caption = "",
          dep.var.labels = "Log-quantity",
          report = "vcs",
          se = list(se_ols),
          omit.stat = c("rsq", "adj.rsq", "ser"),
          omit.table.layout = "n",
          omit = "seas*"
          )
```


Estimated value of price elasticity of demand is `r coef(reg_ols)["ln_price"]` , while its standard error is `r se_ols["ln_price"]`.

**(b) Explain why the interaction of supply and demand could make the OLS estimator of the elasticity obtained in (a) biased.**

Supply and demand compose what we know as **market equilibrium**. Quantity and price are jontly determined in a system of equations and we can only observe market equilibrium, never demand or supply isolated. This jointly determination of variables causes OLS to be biased, something that @Hansen2020 calls _simultaneous equations bias_.

**(c) Consider using the variable cartel as instrumental variable for $\ln(P)$. Use economic reasoning to argue whether cartel plausibly satisfies the two conditions for a valid instrument.**

From economic theory we known that cartel formation can interfere on prices. Companies secretly agrees to charge a higher than competitive markets prices in order to boost their profits, thus the relevance of the instrument is clear.

What is not without some argument is the exclusion condition. Cartels can, and often do, agree on quantities to be produced by members and therefore this instrument is not valid in this case. Specifically on the present situation, we can assume that supply for rail transportation of grains clears the demand, that is, all grains are transported and none is left in stock for long periods of time. Hence, the collusion is not affecting quantities supplied but rather only the prices that grain owners must accept to pay for transport.

Including the cartel data on the data set.

```{r cartel}
data_red$cartel <- JEC$cartel
```

Estimating the IV regression.

```{r iv-reg, results='asis'}
reg_iv <- ivreg(ln_quantity ~ ln_price + . - cartel | . - ln_price + cartel,
                data = data_red)
se_iv <- sqrt(diag(vcovHC(reg_iv, type = "HC1")))

stargazer(reg_iv, reg_ols, type = "latex", header = FALSE,
          label = "tab:q5table2",
          title = "IV and OLS estimation compared.",
          dep.var.labels = "Log-quantity",
          report = "vcs",
          se = list(se_iv, se_ols),
          omit.stat = c("rsq", "adj.rsq", "ser"),
          omit.table.layout = "n",
          omit = "seas*"
          )
```

Utilizing `cartel` as an instrument variable for price, the estimated value of price elasticity of demand is `r coef(reg_iv)["ln_price"]`, while its standard error is `r se_iv["ln_price"]`.

If the instrument is valid and our regression is consistent, then the estimated **OLS bias** is `r coef(reg_ols)["ln_price"] - coef(reg_iv)["ln_price"]`.

**(d) Test, at 5% significance level, the hypothesis that the demand for rail shipping of grain is inelastic.**

Demand for rail shipping of grain is inelastic if its price elasticity is greater than -1, thus our hypothesis test is one-sided.

```{r test1, results = "asis"}
# Auxiliary function to perform t-test
# H0 beta_hat >= beta
ttest <- function(reg, coefnum, val, unilateral = FALSE){
  co <- coef(summary(reg))
  tstat <- (co[coefnum,1] - val)/co[coefnum,2]
  if (unilateral)
    pval <- pt(tstat, reg$df.residual, lower.tail = FALSE)
  else
    pval <- 2*pt(abs(tstat), reg$df.residual, lower.tail = FALSE)
  
  return(data.frame(t_value = tstat, p_value = pval))
}

# ln_price is the second coeficient
test1 <- ttest(reg_iv, 2, -1, unilateral = TRUE)
```

Our t-stat is `r test1$t_value` with a p-value of `r test1$p_value`.

**(e) Test, at 5\% significance level, the hypothesis that the demand elasticity is equal to -1. What is the p-value of this test?**

We can use a asymptotic chi-squared Wald test for a linear restriction test, or the usual two-sided t-test.

```{r test2, results = "asis"}
test2_chi <- linearHypothesis(reg_iv, "ln_price = -1", 
                              vcov. = vcovHC, type = "HC1")
test2_t <- ttest(reg_iv, 2, -1)

df <- tribble(~Test,  ~Statistic, ~`p-value`,
              "t-test", test2_t$t_value, test2_t$p_value,
              "Wald", test2_chi$Chisq[2], test2_chi$`Pr(>Chisq)`[2])

kable(df,
      digits = 4,
      booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left")

```

**(f) One of the reasons for price fluctuations was that the Great Lakes periodically froze, making shipping grain by boat impossible and temporarily increasing the demand for rail. $Ice_i$ is a binary variable that is equal to 1 if the Great Lakes are not navigable because of ice. Consider using the variable Ice as instrumental variable for $\ln(P)$. Use economic reasoning to argue whether Ice plausibly satisfies the two conditions for a valid instrument to estimate demand elasticity for rail shipping of grain.**

$Ice_i$ is actually a demand shifter and should be included in the demand equation. This exogenous variable would help to estimate the parameters from _supply equation_, but would be of no use as an instrument of price when estimating the demand equation.

Eventhough $Ice_i$ is clearly correlated to price, this is a result of its direct impact on quantity demanded and thus the exclusion hypothesis is not satisfied.

## Question 6

**In this exercise, we will study the impact of eminent domain on house prices in the US^1 . Eminent domain (or taking laws) is the legal mechanism through which a government can compulsorily purchase private property. This action is surely controversial, and proprietors can take legal action in order to try to revert such a decision. Federal court rulings declaring that a government takeover was unlawful (pro-plaintiff decisions) uphold property rights and set a precedent that makes future exercise of eminent domain more difficult. Our analysis will thus centre on the impact of pro-plaintiff rulings in federal circuits 2 on housing prices.**

**(a) Import temp `CSHomePrice.mat.csv`. This dataset stores information on house prices (Case-Shiller index) and pro-plaintiff rulings per circuit and period. Note that, except for the log CS index, all data is on a yearly frequency. Aggregate the dataset by year, taking the within-circuit-year average of the log price index.**

Loading the dataset and aggreting it by circut/year.

```{r load-cs, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
CS_home_price <- read_csv("temp_CSHomePrice.mat.csv")

# aggregate by year
cs_year <- CS_home_price %>% 
  group_by(circuit, year) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean)
```

**(b) Run a regression of the log-price index on the total number of pro-plaintiff appellate taking decisions (`numpro_casecat_12`). What do you find? Does this coefficient have a causal interpretation? Why?**

```{r reg1, results="asis"}
reg1 <- lm(logpriceindex ~ numpro_casecat_12, data = cs_year)
vcov_reg1 <- vcovHC(reg1, type = "HC1")
se_reg1 <- sqrt(diag(vcov_reg1))

notes1 <- "Robust standard error in parenthesis."
stargazer(reg1, type = "latex", header = FALSE,
          label = "tab:q6table1",
          title = "OLS estimate of Case-Shiller home price index.",
          dep.var.caption = "",
          dep.var.labels = "log(price index)",
          covariate.labels = c("pro-plaintiff", "Intercept"),
          report = "vcs",

This coefficient does not have a causal interpretation. Chosen regressor is not randomized across all circuits and years and it is very likely that it reflects endogenous conditions we are not observing, for example the number of pro-plaintiff cases depends on total number of cases ruled in that circuit, which in turns may be related to the choice of local governments trying to expropriate private real state in order to set forth infrastructure projects. 

The regression result turns out to be non-significant, thus, one could say that the number of pro-plaintiff cases has no relation to house prices.

**To deal with potential endogeneity, Chen and Yeh (2015) explore the fact that, in federal appellate courts, judges are randomly assigned to three-judge panels to decide appellate cases. Each Circuit Court case receives three _randomly_ assigned judges out of a pool of judges, numbering roughly 8 to 40 depending on the size of the Circuit. Therefore, conditional on the pool characteristics, the realized characteristics of the randomly assigned three-judge panels should satisfy the exclusion restriction, as they can only be related to property prices through the judgesâ decisions.**

**(c) Match dataset `probs.txt` to your data. This dataset stores the distribution of characteristics in each circuit pool from 1945 to 2007.**

```{r probs, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
probs <- read_table2("probs.txt")

# Merge two datasets by left join cs_year and probs.
# Select the appropriate variables for next questions
cs_probs <- cs_year %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(probs, by = c("circuit" = "Scircuit", "year" = "Syear")) %>% 
  select(logpriceindex, numpro_casecat_12, missing_cy_12, numcasecat_12, 
         numpanels1x_dem, starts_with("prob"), -starts_with("prob_x"))
```

**(d) We propose to run the following model:**


\begin{equation}
\ln(Case\_Shiller)_{ct} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 numpro\_casecat\_12_{ct} + \gamma'W_{ct} +  \epsilon_{ct}
(\#eq:case-shiller)
\end{equation}

**where $W_{ct}$ includes the full set of controls for judicial pool characteristics; a dummy for whether there were no cases in that circuit-year (`missing_cy_12`), and the number of takings appellate decisions (`numcasecat_12`). As an instrument, we choose the number of panels with at least one Democrat (`numpanels1x_dem`).**

Let's check the instrument relevance. We'll regress the pro-plaintiff variable `numpro_casecat_12` on the instrument `numpanels1x_dem` and all control variables and check the t statistic of this coefficient.

```{r q6fisrt-stage, results="asis"}
first_stage <- lm(paste0("numpro_casecat_12 ~ numpanels1x_dem+", controls),
                  data = cs_probs)

stargazer(coeftest(first_stage), type = "latex", header = FALSE,
          label = "tab:q6table3",
          title = "First stage estimate.",
          model.names = FALSE,
          dep.var.labels = "pro-plaintiff",
          report = "vc*stp",
          omit = c("prob*", "missing*", "numcase*"),
          omit.stat = c("rsq", "ser")
          )

```

Since the estimated coefficient related to the instrument is not significant, we can infer this instrument is weak and should not be used.

Again, the results from regression in Table \@ref(tab:q6table2) are not significant for pro-plaintiff variable although this time, using controls and IV, the point estimate is negative. If the results were in fact significant, we could have done causal inference according to the authors. That is because, **after** controlling for circuit characteristics, judges are randomly assigned to cases and thus, selection bias is (should be) eliminated.

**(e) Do you think the coefficient found in (d) is a credible estimate of the causal effect we set ourselves to analyse? Why? If the answer is negative, could you use the data available and run an alternative specification that would produce more credible estimates? What did you find?**

No it's not. We have showed this is a weak instrument and as such, our estimated coefficient for pro-plaintiff variable is not reliable. When a weak instrument is utilized, it is very well possible that the IV bias is even **larger** than OLS bias.

We can try to find another instrument. STILL NEED TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DATA.
